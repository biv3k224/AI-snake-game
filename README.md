<h1>🐍 Snake AI Game (Python)</h1>

A simple Snake game built in Python with two modes:
- Human Mode – play the game yourself
- AI Mode – watch an AI learn to play Snake and visualize its learning progress
<br>This project demonstrates basic game development using Pygame and reinforcement learning concepts.</br>
